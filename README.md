# Geog-agent-based-model
<p> This model was created in anacoda using python, and is a model to show agents interacting with the envrionment in an animation. The agents within the model eat the environemtn and share it with the neighbours. </br>
There are also another set of agents named the predators who move twice as fast and the aim of those was to eat the agents, however this proved difficult to try and delete from a list within a loop, further study is required. </br>
The agent framework code must be run first to inistilise the model then the model code itself can be run as the model pulls from the agent framework</br>
When the model is run a window will open and you need to navigate to the top of the GUI to run the model</br>
This will play the animation and at current standing the animations runs for 1000 iterations </br>
Future development will have the predator class kill the agent class and that will stop the animation or have all of the agents eat the environment whichever comes first.</p>
